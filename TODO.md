# TODO
Mostly for me, but feel free to contribute if you'd like.

- Add autocompletion (possibly via [click-completion](https://github.com/click-contrib/click-completion)) (#1)
- Add transactions export (probably with [tablib](https://github.com/kennethreitz/tablib)) (#5)
- Add a third party tap and a custom Homebrew formula (#6)
